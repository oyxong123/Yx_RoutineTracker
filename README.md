# Yx-RoutineTracker

Yx-RoutineTracker is a lightweight routine to-do app I built with Qt to manage my own routines. 
I designed it with the philosophy of having it as functionality and aesthetically minimalistic as possible, as that is my preference. 
It only contains functionalities that I personally needed. 

The app consists of functionalities to manage daily and recurring routines, track completion history, and prioritize routines through an intuitive and compact interface. 
It runs as a system tray icon and can be accessed on the laptop by clicking on the system tray icon anytime. 

As of now, the app supports:
- Daily
- Weekly
- Biweekly
- Monthly
- Quarterly
- Semiannually
- Annually
- Day
- Interval

I personally run this app in the background on my laptop 24/7. 
It had saved me the effort to keep track of my routines manually using Microsoft Excel, and had helped me streamlined my routine tracking process.
In addition to that, I built this with the aim that it could help others that want a minimalistic routine tracker in their life. 
The app have proved to be a reliable utility program for my own personal life. 

Feel to to try it out, share it with others, and let me know if the app personally helped you tremendously!
